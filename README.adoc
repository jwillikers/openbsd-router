The configuration for my {OpenBSD} home router.
I use a {Protectli} vault, which I highly recommend.

// https://sha256.net/dhcpv6-pd-first-steps.html
// todo Provide additional static, local IPv6 addresses through DHCPv6 on my local network.
// Then provide IPv6 addresses for the DNS servers on the router.
// This will require using ISC's kea, `kea` package, instead of the local dhcp server.

== Overview

This configuration is intended for OpenBSD {OpenBSD-version}.

todo Describe VLAN configuration and how everything ties together.

todo Discuss issues preferring IPv6 over IPv4.

== Usage

. Install OpenBSD.
The process is documented in the https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html[OpenBSD FAQ - Installation Guide]
No graphical utilities are needed.

. Install the necessary packages.
+
[,sh]
----
doas pkg_add dhcpcd fish git tailscale tmux vim
----

. Clone the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/openbsd-router
----

. Change to the project's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd openbsd-router
----

. Install or symlink everything.
Someday, Id like to create a better way to automate this.
And care really needs to be taken when modifying the doas configuration.
I should add special instructions for that as well.

. Add the authentication and encryption passphrases for the SNMPv3 user in the `/etc/snmpd.users.conf` file.
+
./etc/etc/snmpd.users.conf
[source]
----
user "monitor" auth hmac-sha256 authkey "******" enc aes enckey "******"
----

. Set ownership on the snmpd configuration files.
+
[,sh]
----
doas chown root:_snmpd /etc/snmpd.conf /etc/snmpd.users.conf
----

. Set permissions on the snmpd configuration files.
+
[,sh]
----
doas chmod u=w,g=r,o= /etc/snmpd.conf /etc/snmpd.users.conf
----

. Reboot to finish the installation.

== Verify Configuration Files

snmpd:: `doas snmpd -n`
