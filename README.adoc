The configuration for running my home {OpenBSD} router.
I use a {Protectli} vault, which I highly recommend.

// todo Provide additional static, local IPv6 addresses through DHCPv6 on my local network.
// Then provide IPv6 addresses for the DNS servers on the router.
// This will require using ISC's kea, `kea` package, instead of the local dhcp server.
